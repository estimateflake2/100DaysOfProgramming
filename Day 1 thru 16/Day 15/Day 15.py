#========================== Virtual Coffee Machine
# This program simulates a coin-operated coffee machine.
# It manages limited resources (water, milk, coffee), processes user coin input,
# checks if resources and payment are sufficient, and dispenses one of three drinks
# (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino). It also includes a hidden "off" command to stop the machine.

#1) Make 3 Hot Flavors
    #Expresso ($1.50): #50 ml Water #18g Coffee
    #Latte ($2.50): #200ml Water #24g Coffee #150ml Milk
    #Cappuccino ($3.00): #250ml Water #24g Coffee #100ml Milk

    #The Coffee Machine has the following resources to Manage:
        #300ml of water, 200ml of milk, 100g of coffee
#Coint Operated:
    #Penny (1 cent), Nickel (5 cents), Dime (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents)

#Programming Requirements:
    # TODO 1) Needs to be able to tell what resources are remaining.
    # TODO 2) Check for resource availability (sufficiency) when a user orders a drink
    # TODO 3) Must be able to process coins
    # TODO 4) Must be able to check for successful transaction
    # TODO 5) Make coffee
    # TODO 6) Has a secret "off" command to turn the machine off
